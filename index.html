<p>My prices do vary from website to website depending on the style, how many
  pages, and interactive pop-ups customers want. here is a rough estimate on
  my prices.

  <table class="center">
  <tr>
    <th>number of pages</th>
    <th>style prices</th>
    <th>prices</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$100 per page</td>
      <td>$50 per style type</td>
